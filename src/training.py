        params - Dictionary object containing model and training parameters. The relevant
        parameters are model_order (which determines whether the SINDy model predicts first or
        second order time derivatives), sequential_thresholding (which indicates whether or not
        coefficient thresholding is performed), coefficient_mask (optional if sequential
        thresholding is performed; 0/1 mask that selects the relevant coefficients in the SINDy
        model), and learning rate (float that determines the learning rate).
